### How `surveilr` Works

- **Stateful Data Integration**: Unlike simple data transfer tools, `surveilr`
  doesn’t just move information between systems. It stores and organizes data in
  a way that is standardized, making it easy to query and manage.

- **Local-First, Edge-Based**: `surveilr` processes data as close as possible to
  where it is collected—on local devices, laptops, or edge systems. This reduces
  the need for unnecessary data transfers, keeping sensitive data secure by
  handling it locally before sending it to a central location.

- **SQL-Centric**: `surveilr` uses the power of SQL, a universal database
  language, to ensure your data can be accessed, searched, and analyzed
  efficiently.

### Why Does This Matter?

For industries like **regulatory science**, **cybersecurity**, and
**healthcare**, **`surveilr`** ensures that critical data—whether it's
regulatory reports, cybersecurity logs, or patient records—can be managed safely
and efficiently. It supports **secure data transmission** and guarantees that
sensitive information is anonymized or de-identified when needed, helping your
organization remain compliant with **HIPAA**, **GDPR** and other data protection
standards.

### Key Benefits

- **Streamlined Compliance**: `surveilr` ensures that all compliance evidence is
  collected, organized, and ready for audit, saving time and reducing human
  error.

- **Data Security**: `surveilr`’s edge-based approach ensures data stays secure
  by limiting unnecessary movement of sensitive information. Only what’s needed
  is transferred to central servers, reducing exposure and risks.

- **Interoperability**: `surveilr` integrates seamlessly with your existing
  systems, whether it’s email, databases, or software like GitHub or Jira,
  ensuring a smooth exchange of information across platforms.

- **Scalability**: Whether you're handling a small team or a large enterprise,
  `surveilr`’s flexible architecture adapts to your needs, providing a secure,
  efficient solution that grows with your organization.

### Why `surveilr` is So Widely Applicable

One of the key reasons **`surveilr`** is so widely applicable across industries
is because it’s a **complete SQL-based data aggregation and orchestration
platform**. At its core is an opinionated, superbly designed **universal
relational database schema** that can handle content from almost any source.
This powerful schema, coupled with **`surveilr`’s content assembler**, allows it
to support not only industry-neutral formats like:

- **Text**
- **JSON**
- **XML**
- **Excel**
- **Parquet**
- **CSV**

but also industry-specific formats such as:

- **X.12 (Electronic Data Interchange)**
- **HL7 v2 (Healthcare Messaging Standard)**
- **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)**

In today’s digital landscape, most of the data that businesses rely on to make
decisions is scattered across a multitude of systems. Data might be locked away
in **emails**, **product lifecycle management (PLM) systems** such as GitHub,
GitLab, Jira, or Asana, or **project management systems** like Trello,
Monday.com, and others. Similarly, **systems of record** such as **Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) systems** (like Salesforce or HubSpot),
**Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems** (like SAP or Oracle), and
**Electronic Health Records (EHRs)** in the healthcare industry house vital
information that’s critical for decision making.

However, this data is not always readily accessible in one place. Pulling
together information from these siloed systems to get a unified view for
decision making is an enormous challenge for most organizations. **`surveilr`**
steps in to bridge this gap by acting as a **universal data aggregator**,
capable of pulling data from multiple, disparate sources and organizing it in a
way that is **instantly queryable**.

A single **edge-based binary** of `surveilr` can securely pull data from these
sources—be it emails, PLM systems, CRMs, ERPs, or specialized industry
formats—and prepare it for **uniform querying** using SQL-friendly tools.
Whether you are trying to aggregate evidence from multiple **SaaS platforms**,
gather information from **log files**, or collate data from a variety of
**knowledgebases** and **local files**, `surveilr` makes it possible to bring
all that information into a cohesive, structured format.

This capability is particularly valuable because it **eliminates the need for
complex data migrations** or manual data extraction efforts, which are often
costly and time-consuming. By supporting both **local-first** processing and
**cloud-based deployments**, `surveilr` provides the flexibility to process
sensitive data behind firewalls, anonymize or clean it if necessary, and then
share or store it securely. The ability to consolidate **human-generated** and
**machine-generated** evidence into a single **uniform format** makes audits,
compliance checks, and decision-making far easier and more effective.

By using `surveilr` as a **universal data aggregator**, businesses can
confidently prepare and share data across internal and external systems with the
peace of mind that it has been properly processed, anonymized, and secured.

### `surveilr` for Vendor Assessment and Corporate Compliance

In industries where supply chain partners are involved—such as healthcare,
energy, and cybersecurity—vendors must often evaluate and police each other’s
policy adherence. **`surveilr`** enables companies to do just that in a secure
and efficient way.

With **`surveilr`**, you can collect **policy adherence evidence** directly from
systems behind corporate firewalls. Sensitive data can be anonymized or removed
entirely, allowing organizations to share just the evidence required to prove
compliance without exposing proprietary or personal information. This is
particularly valuable in **vendor assessments**, where transparency is
essential, but security and privacy cannot be compromised.

Corporate compliance leaders and cybersecurity officers can also use
**`surveilr`** to gather data anonymously or with attribution, depending on the
need. Whether through automated processes or manual reviews, `surveilr` allows
organizations to enforce or audit policy adherence by capturing activities
across systems and verifying whether individuals or teams are following
established procedures. By pulling data from emails, lifecycle tools like
GitHub, SaaS platforms, or logs, **`surveilr`** provides a clear picture of
whether key standards are being met.

#### Quality Management for Safety-Critical Industries

Industries such as **healthcare**, **energy**, **aviation**, and other
safety-critical sectors require stringent **quality management** protocols to
ensure the safety of their operations. In these environments, failure to adhere
to quality protocols can have serious consequences.

**`surveilr`** is a powerful tool for quality management organizations tasked
with collecting and auditing data to ensure that staff are following proper
protocols. By aggregating data from disparate systems and auditing logs or
records, `surveilr` makes it easier to verify that proper safety and quality
processes are in place. Whether for internal audits, external regulatory
reviews, or continuous quality improvement, `surveilr` helps ensure that
critical operations adhere to the highest standards.

### `surveilr` Enables Easier Evidence-Based Decision Making

**Evidence-based decision making** is the process of using data and factual
evidence to guide important business decisions, ensuring that choices are
grounded in reality rather than intuition or incomplete information. While this
approach is critical for success, executives often struggle with gathering
enough reliable evidence to make sound decisions. According to **Harvard
Business Review**, many executives lack the data they need for decision making,
which is often scattered across systems, incomplete, or difficult to access
[[HBR, 2020](https://hbr.org/2020/01/how-executives-can-make-better-decisions)].

The challenges of evidence-based decision making are exacerbated by the lack of
a unified approach to collecting **human-generated** and **machine-generated**
evidence. Most businesses today rely on a patchwork of systems that store data
in different formats, with no single platform capable of pulling everything
together into a cohesive, queryable format. This is where **`surveilr`** stands
out.

Unlike other tools that handle data exchanges but leave the data unorganized,
`surveilr` not only gathers data from multiple sources but also **organizes it
into a unified format** that is instantly queryable. This means that the
evidence collected—whether it's from emails, databases, SaaS tools, log files,
or industry-specific formats like HL7 or FHIR—can be queried and analyzed with
ease using **SQL-friendly tools**. For business analysts and executives, this
makes it much easier to extract insights, run reports, and make informed
decisions based on the evidence at hand.

Moreover, `surveilr` can act as a complete **evidence warehouse**. It securely
aggregates data behind firewalls, cleans and anonymizes it where necessary, and
allows for the **local storage of evidence** on devices as small as laptops. At
the same time, it can scale to support cloud-based evidence repositories,
ensuring secure, queryable access to data across the organization.

Other evidence-gathering tools on the market often fail to deliver this level of
organization. They may facilitate the transfer of data between systems but do
not prepare the data in a structured, **uniformly queryable format**.
**`surveilr`**, on the other hand, is designed specifically to handle this
challenge, ensuring that evidence-based decision making becomes a smoother, more
efficient process.

In today's fast-paced business environment, where executives need access to
trustworthy data to make informed decisions, **`surveilr`** delivers the
unified, secure, and queryable platform that makes evidence-based decision
making possible.

### Unlimited Integration Possibilities with Capturable Executables (CEs)

Traditional integration tools like **Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs)**, **API
connectors**, and services like **Zapier** are designed to connect external
systems to each other. They allow data to flow between various platforms,
enabling communication across applications. While these tools are highly
effective at linking systems together, they typically just **move data** from
one system to another without retaining a centralized, **queryable state**. This
is where **Capturable Executables (CEs)** in **`surveilr`** offer a unique
advantage.

**Capturable Executables (CEs)** are focused not just on **connecting systems**
but on **ingesting data** from arbitrary sources, in almost any format, using
**any connector technology or technique**. Unlike typical ESBs or API connectors
that simply transfer data between systems, CEs capture this data and store it in
**`surveilr`'s** stateful **uniform resource** database, where it becomes
**queryable**. This means that instead of simply linking systems, **`surveilr`**
transforms the data into an organized, **evidence-based resource** that can be
used for audits, reports, and decision-making.

**Capturable Executables (CEs)** are custom scripts that can be written in **any
programming language** to connect to various systems, extract or generate data,
and fully integrate that data into **`surveilr`’s** **opinionated universal
database schema**. These scripts allow businesses to customize their integration
processes, ensuring that no matter what system or format the data comes from, it
can be captured, stored, and made available for analysis.

When **`surveilr`** performs an **ingest command**, it typically looks for
files, extracts their content, and stores them as records in a **uniform
resource** table. However, sometimes the data doesn’t already exist in a static
file—it needs to be **generated**. That’s where **CEs** become invaluable. CEs
allow businesses to execute scripts, gather data in real time, and capture the
output for storage in **`surveilr`**.

At the core of **CEs** is the idea that scripts—whether they're simple shell
scripts or complex programs—can be executed by **`surveilr`**, and their
**output** can be captured and treated as part of the evidence warehouse. The
process works like this:

- **Executing Custom Scripts**: When a specific type of file is encountered (for
  example, `abc.surveilr.sh`), **`surveilr`** can execute the script using a
  designated **Capturable Executable (CE)**. The script is run safely, and its
  output (whether JSON, SQL, or other formats) is captured.

- **Storing the Output**: Once the script has run, the output from **STDOUT**
  and any potential error messages from **STDERR** are stored directly into
  **`surveilr`’s uniform resource table**. This allows the generated data to
  become part of the evidence warehouse, where it can be queried, audited, and
  analyzed alongside data from other sources.

- **Processing Instructions (PIs)**: Customization is achieved through
  **Processing Instructions (PIs)** embedded in filenames or passed as arguments
  during execution. For example, a script called `myfile.surveilr-SQL.sh` would
  indicate that the output is **SQL** and should be executed as a **batch SQL
  transaction** within the `surveilr` database.

CEs are a powerful tool because they provide **unlimited integration
possibilities**. Unlike traditional systems that rely on rigid, predefined
connectors, CEs allow businesses to:

- **Ingest from any system**: Whether it’s a legacy application, a modern API,
  or an internal system that doesn’t have a typical connector, a custom CE
  script can be written to extract or generate data and pass it into
  **`surveilr`**.

- **Generate and capture data dynamically**: Not all data comes from static
  files. Sometimes, data needs to be generated in real-time—whether it’s pulling
  information from a database, running a diagnostic tool, or creating complex
  batch files. CEs enable this dynamic data generation.

- **Store output in a standardized format**: No matter what the output of the CE
  script is—JSON, SQL, text, or other formats—**`surveilr`** can capture and
  store it in a **uniform resource table**, making the data easily accessible
  and queryable for business analysts.

The ability to execute scripts and capture their output makes **`surveilr`** a
unique tool for **building an evidence warehouse**. Instead of relying solely on
existing data, CEs allow businesses to **pull in data from custom sources** or
generate new data on the fly. This means that **`surveilr`** can act in a
similar way to API connectors, ESBs, and other integration engines, but with the
added benefit of **fully integrating the data** into a **stateful**,
**queryable** evidence warehouse.

**Capturable Executables (CEs)** empower organizations to create a flexible,
highly customized integration process that not only gathers data but also stores
it in a meaningful, standardized format. With CEs, businesses can break free
from the limitations of traditional connectors and integration tools, giving
them the power to capture, process, and store data from virtually any source,
securely and efficiently.
