The Resource Surveillance & Integration Engine (`surveilr`) is a stateful data preparation, orchestration and integration platform for mission critical systems that need to integrate and operate on common data in a local-first, edge-based SQL-centric manner.

- Stateful means that the `surveilr` is not just passing data between multiple sytems but allows storing the data in an opinionated universal relational database schema.
- SQL-centric means that data should be queryable and orchestratable via a SQL.
- Local-first means that content should be prepared and processed locally before going to a cloud or central server.
- Edge-based means that data should be handled as close to where the data is collected rather than everything being done centrally.

A typical use for `surveilr`'s stateful, local-first, edge-based SQL-centric capabilities is to aggregate compliance, cybsecurity, regulatory science, and machine attestation evidence. 

Another typical use case is complex medical data integration tasks (e.g. HL7 FHIR or CCDs). 

While `surveilr` can help with almost any integration tasks, `surveilr` is particularly useful to help integrate "evidence" data for from multiple systems to prove the existence of absence of policy adherence.

`surveilr` supports a variety of technologies to ensure smooth communication and data transfer for evidentiary data. 

To help aggregate different types of evidence generated from a multitude of systems, `surveilr` supports ingestion from local and remote files, IMAP email ingestion, ingestion from product lifecycle management systems such as GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and others.

`surveilr` provides opinionated architecture and design guidance for file placement in designated ingestions folders using technologies like WebDAV, SFTP, and virtual printers in case files need to be sourced from third party systems. 

It works with various message formats including CSV, JSON, XML, Excel, Parquet, and any tabular data formats. 

`surveilr` can connect directly to customer systems via SQL for database-level exchanges, and it integrates with webhook APIs to trigger actions based on data retrieved from third-party databases.

In addition to simplifying data exchange processes, `surveilr`'s local-first, stateful, edge-based architecture helps reduce sensitive data exposure (HIPAA-compliance) by allowing data to be anonymized or deidentified before going to central servers.

The Integration Engine operates through a small, yet powerful and easy manageable single binary multi-OS application that resides on any device like a phone, workstations and laptop PCs, or servers in the cloud with highly secure environment. 

Its primary role is to collect data from the host systems (the system where the data originates), and securely transmit designated third-party systems, it also collect/process data from the third party system and transfer the same to the source systems in a secure way.

This process is fundamental to ensuring that sensitive data is shared safely and efficiently across different platforms.
